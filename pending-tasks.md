- production mode should use pm2
- salt on authentication with sqlite
- should we dockerize mysqlite? Easier for data persistance I guess.
- Some routes on auth like verify token, forgot password and etc not working

- Routes not working: forgot password, verify email, resend verification email, verify JWT token - some of them were made when our email system wasnt functional yet
